**Last Updated: December 9, 2024**

**Effective Date: December 9, 2024**

## Introduction

Welcome to Tie Staff ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how Pymesoft LLC ("Company") collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards your information when you use our Tie Staff mobile application (the "App"). The App is a workforce management tool designed for staff members to manage their work schedules, clock in/out of shifts, communicate with managers, and track their work assignments.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the App.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Personal Information You Provide

When you create an account or use the App, we may collect the following personal information:

- **Account Information**: Email address, first name, last name, and phone number
- **Authentication Data**: Login credentials through Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In
- **Profile Information**: Profile picture (if provided through your sign-in provider)
- **Work Preferences**: Your preferred default tab/view within the app

### 2. Information Collected Automatically

When you use the App, we automatically collect certain information:

- **Device Information**: Device type (iOS or Android), device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers
- **Usage Data**: App interactions, features used, timestamps of actions, error logs, and crash reports
- **Push Notification Tokens**: Device tokens for delivering push notifications

### 3. Location Information

**Important**: We collect precise location data only when necessary for specific work-related features:

- **Clock-In/Clock-Out Verification**: When you clock in or out of a shift, we collect your precise location (GPS coordinates) to verify you are at the designated work venue
- **Geofence Monitoring**: With your permission, the App may monitor your location in the background to enable automatic clock-in when you arrive within 500 meters of your assigned work venue and within 2 minutes of your shift start time
- **Venue Proximity**: Location data is used to calculate distance from event venues for attendance verification

You can disable location services at any time through your device settings, though this may limit certain App functionality like automatic clock-in.

### 4. Audio Data

- **Voice Input**: If you use voice input features (AI assistant), we process audio recordings to transcribe your spoken requests. Audio data is processed in real-time and is not stored permanently.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

### Core App Functionality
